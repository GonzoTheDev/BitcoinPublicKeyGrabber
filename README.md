# BitcoinPublicKeyGrabber
A python program that finds the public keys to a list of bitcoin addresses if they are known.


# Usage
Simply place the bitcoin addresses you want to look up in the addresses.csv file, one address per line and then run the python script. The program will output the public keys to txt file called pubkeys.txt.
 
 I put 10 known bitcoin addresses from the richlist into addresses.csv for example data.
